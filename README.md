# Ismael Aderdor dotfiles
Hi! Those are the dotfiles I use. Moreover, this repo has a file for installing all the apps that I use. Please note that those files are meant to be used with manjaro.

Those dotfiles have the configuration for the next programs:

 - atom
 - neovim
 - tmux
 - i3wm and i3 status bar



## Use

First, you install all the requirements.

If you are using manjaro:

	```bash
	yaourt -S --noconfirm - < pkg_manjaro.txt
	yaourt -S --noconfirm - < pkg_manjaro_aur.txt
	```

[TODO] Yes, I must do something with the instalation script.

After running stow, you should run `fc-cache` to be able to use the fonts.


## Licence

Unless some file says the opposite, this project is under the MIT licence.
